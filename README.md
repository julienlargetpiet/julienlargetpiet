    <h3>About Me</h3>
    
<p>I’m passionate about <b>programming</b> and always excited to explore new languages and <b>paradigms</b>. My journey in coding has given me a deep appreciation for <b>functional programming</b>, especially Haskell, which has shaped the way I approach problems with elegance and precision.</p>

<p><b>Mathematics</b> has always been close to my heart, and through programming, I’ve delved into areas like <b>graph theory, number theory, set theory, statistics and Machine Learning</b>. This mathematical curiosity naturally extends to machine learning, where I enjoy experimenting with C++, R, and Python to build models and analyze data.</p>

<p>Algorithms are my true love, indeed, they’re the backbone of every solution I craft, and I take pleasure in optimizing and reasoning about them.</p>

<p>On the systems side, I have experience with network programming, including HTTP servers and Unix sockets, giving me a solid foundation in low-level programming and networking concepts.</p>

<p>I’m endlessly curious and love experimenting with new frameworks and technologies. For me, programming is not just a skill, it’s a playground for exploration, problem-solving, and continuous learning.</p>
